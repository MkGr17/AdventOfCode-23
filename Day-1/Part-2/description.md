# Advent of Code - Day 1: Digit Spelling Conversion

## Problem Statement

Your calculation isn't quite right. 
It looks like some of the digits are actually spelled out with letters: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine also count as valid "digits".
Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first and last digit on each line. For example:

## Example

Consider the following examples:

- `two1nine` => Calibration value: 29
- `eightwothree` => Calibration value: 83
- `abcone2threexyz` => Calibration value: 13
- `xtwone3four` => Calibration value: 24
- `4nineeightseven2` => Calibration value: 42
- `zoneight234` => Calibration value: 14
- `7pqrstsixteen` => Calibration value: 76

The sum of these calibration values is 281.
